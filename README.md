# Tip-Calculator
### The challenge
The  challenge is to build out a tip calculator app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
Users should be able to:
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person
- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
